###light
	.light is an artwork from the object "everything-stays": the lightness of the color changes during the day and it is higher at 12:00, and during the night form 6 till 18 it stays at a 20% minimum. The hue shifts once every hour (for now a bit faster) throught the whole spectrum.
	 
	The change of color is next to indistinguishable for the viewer during the typical length of say, but that does not mean that such a change is not present. During a second viewing minutes, of hours later the shifting of the color would be apparent.
	
	But finally it has a cylclical algorythm, returning the system to a previous state.
