##.light
	.light is an artwork from the object "everything-stays":
	the lightness of the color changes during the day
	and it is higher at 12:00, and during the night from 6 till 18
	it stays at a 20% minimum. The hue shifts once every hour
	(for now a bit faster) through the whole spectrum.
	 
	The change of color is next to indistinguishable for the viewer
	during the typical length of stay, but that does not mean that
	such a change is not present. During a second viewing, minutes
	or hours later, the shifting of the color would be apparent.
	
	But finally it has a cyclical algorithm, returning the system
	to a previous state.
