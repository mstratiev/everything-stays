			<strong>.light</strong> is an artwork from the object "everything-stays":
			the lightness of the color changes during the day and it is higher at 12:00,
			and during the night form 6 till 18 it stays at a 20% minimum.
			The hue shifts once every hour (for now a bit faster) throught the whole spectrum.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			The change of color is next to indistinguishable for the
			viewer during the typical length of say, but that does not mean that such a change is not present.
			During a second viewing minutes, of hours later the shifting of the color would be apparent.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			But finally it has a cylclical algorythm, returning the system to a previous state.
